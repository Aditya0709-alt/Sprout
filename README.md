## Background

Home gardens grant access to cheaper, fresher and more sustainable produce. Owning a home garden is one of the simplest things that one can do to move towards self-sufficiency and reducing the load on the environment. Besides this, one can control what fertilizers and pesticides go into the plant. Apart from this, it adds to the aesthetic value and provides a positive environment at home. However, in today’s world, people live busy lives. They have many different tasks to focus on, like their jobs, education, and side projects. Most people do not have the time or resources available to make or maintain a home garden.
Hydroponics is the study of growing plants in a liquid nutrient medium, without the need for soil. The roots of the plant are immersed in the nutrient solution, and the plants receive their nourishment from there.

## Objective

To design and build a system that automates the process of monitoring the plant’s health and watering/fertilizing it. The relevant information about the nutrient levels, pH, humidity and temperature should also be available to the user.

## Scope

- This project specifically targets hydroponic farming. The reason for this is that hydroponic farms are more cost effective and easier to control with the help of pumps.
- This product only targets the people living in urban or suburban areas, who want to have an indoor farm without the hassle of having to maintain it.
- Although the target audience is limited, even actual hydroponic farmers working on larger scales may make use of this system by scaling it up.
- This project is intended to be a prototype and a proof of concept.
- A successful prototype would be one that would be able to fully regulate the nutrient concentration by making use of pumps. It should also be able to report the current nutrient concentration in the medium, along with the current pH and temperature through a webpage.
- While this project is intended to be as energy efficient as possible, there will be no special provisions for powering it using renewable energy. It will be powered directly through a standard 220V power outlet.
